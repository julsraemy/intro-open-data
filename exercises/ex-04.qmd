## Discovering Research Data Platforms


::: {.callout-note}
## Instructions
[re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) (Registry of Research Data Repositories) is a global registry of research data repositories from different academic disciplines. It provides detailed information about repository features, standards, and policies. Visit <https://www.re3data.org/> to answer the following questions.
:::

a) **Persistent Identifiers**: Which cross-institutional repository based in Switzerland provides ARK (Archival Resource Key) identifiers? Find and provide an example ARK from this repository.

b) **Repository Software**: How many life sciences repositories built on Invenio RDM are listed on re3data? Name another well-known general-purpose repository that also uses Invenio RDM.

c) **Data Accessibility**: Examine Yareta (University of Geneva's research data repository). What types of data access does it support? Is all data openly accessible, or are there restrictions?

d) **Certification & Trust**: Which Swiss research data repository has received the CoreTrustSeal certification? What does this certification indicate about a repository?

e) **Terms of Use and Licences**: What licences does the OLOS repository (Open Access Repository of Bern University of Applied Sciences) support for deposited materials?

f) **Repository Policies**: Does Yareta have a preservation policy? If so, what does it specify about long-term data retention?

g) **Additional Information**: Compare the subject coverage between OLOS and Yareta. Which repository is more discipline-specific, and which is more general-purpose?

## Hints

- **a) Persistent Identifiers**: On re3data, try filtering by country (Switzerland) and by persistent identifier type (ARK). The repository you are looking for is tied to a national-level infrastructure for research data in the humanities and social sciences. Once you find it, browse its collections to locate an example ARK — these typically start with `ark:/`.
- **b) Repository Software**: Use re3data's filters to narrow down by software (Invenio RDM) and subject (life sciences). For the general-purpose repository, think about the most well-known open-access platform used by researchers worldwide to deposit datasets — it is operated by CERN.
- **c) Data Accessibility**: Look at the Yareta entry on re3data and check the "Data access" section. Pay attention to whether the repository distinguishes between metadata access and data file access — not all content may be freely downloadable, even if the metadata is visible.
- **d) Certification & Trust**: On re3data, filter Swiss repositories by certification type (CoreTrustSeal). CoreTrustSeal is a community-based certification focusing on sustainable and trustworthy data infrastructure. Think about what guarantees it gives depositors and reusers.
- **e) Terms of Use and Licences**: Check the OLOS entry on re3data and look at its licence information. Consider whether it supports Creative Commons licences and if depositors can choose from multiple options.
- **f) Repository Policies**: Look at Yareta's re3data entry for its preservation policy details. Check whether a specific retention period is mentioned and whether it commits to keeping data beyond the end of a research project.
- **g) Additional Information**: Compare the "Subject" fields of both OLOS and Yareta on re3data. One is affiliated with a specific university of applied sciences (which may reflect in its subject focus), while the other serves a broader research university context.
