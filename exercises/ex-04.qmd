## Discovering Research Data Platforms


::: {.callout-note}
## Instructions
[re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) (Registry of Research Data Repositories) is a global registry of research data repositories from different academic disciplines. It provides detailed information about repository features, standards, and policies. Visit <https://www.re3data.org/> to answer the following questions.
:::

a) **Persistent Identifiers**: Which cross-institutional repository based in Switzerland provides ARK (Archival Resource Key) identifiers? Find and provide an example ARK from this repository.

b) **Repository Software**: How many life sciences repositories built on Invenio RDM are listed on re3data? Name another well-known general-purpose repository that also uses Invenio RDM.

c) **Data Accessibility**: Examine Yareta (University of Geneva's research data repository). What types of data access does it support? Is all data openly accessible, or are there restrictions?

d) **Certification & Trust**: Which Swiss research data repository has received the CoreTrustSeal certification? What does this certification indicate about a repository?

e) **Terms of Use and Licences**: What licences does the OLOS repository (Open Access Repository of Bern University of Applied Sciences) support for deposited materials?

f) **Repository Policies**: Does Yareta have a preservation policy? If so, what does it specify about long-term data retention?

g) **Additional Information**: Compare the subject coverage between OLOS and Yareta. Which repository is more discipline-specific, and which is more general-purpose?
