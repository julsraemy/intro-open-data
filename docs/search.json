However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

    "text": "Data scraping is the automated process of extracting information from websites or other online sources. This technique can be useful for collecting data from multiple sites and automating repetitive tasks. However, challenges include adapting to changes in website layouts, legal and ethical issues, and handling dynamic content (e.g. data loaded via JavaScript). For example, Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup or frameworks like Scrapy are frequently used for these purposes.\n\n\n\nAPI integration involves connecting to external services in order to retrieve structured data, often in real time. This method provides standardised data access and can streamline automated processes. Nevertheless, it requires managing API rate limits, adapting to changes in the API, and integrating data from various systems.\n\n\n\nData mining refers to the analysis of large datasets to identify patterns, correlations, and trends. This process can support data-driven decision-making, though it requires significant computational resources and expertise, and may also raise privacy concerns. Software such as RapidMiner and WEKA is commonly used in this field.\n\n\n\nData wrangling (or data munging) is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organising raw data into a structured format that is suitable for analysis. Although this process can be time-consuming and technically challenging, it is essential for improving data quality. Python’s pandas library is a widely used tool in this area.\n\n\n\nData integration involves combining data from different sources to create a unified dataset. This technique helps provide a comprehensive view for analysis but may involve challenges such as reconciling differing formats and schemas, and ensuring consistent data quality.\n\n\n\nStream processing refers to analysing data in real time as it is generated. This technique is especially useful for handling time-sensitive data and high volumes of information. Tools such as Apache Kafka and Apache Flink are commonly used to manage data flows and enable real-time analytics.\n\n\n\nData quality management is the process of ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and consistent. High-quality data is critical for reliable analysis, although maintaining such quality requires ongoing monitoring and may be resource-intensive.\n\n\n\nETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load and describes the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a standard format, and loading it into a target system for analysis. This approach supports data consolidation but also poses challenges in maintaining transformation accuracy and managing diverse data sources.",

Software such as RapidMiner and WEKA is commonly used in this field.\n\n\n\nData wrangling (or data munging) is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organising raw data into a structured format that is suitable for analysis. Although this process can be time-consuming and technically challenging, it is essential for improving data quality. Python’s pandas library is a widely used tool in this area.\n\n\n\nData integration involves combining data from different sources to create a unified dataset. This technique helps provide a comprehensive view for analysis but may involve challenges such as reconciling differing formats and schemas, and ensuring consistent data quality.\n\n\n\nStream processing refers to analysing data in real time as it is generated. This technique is especially useful for handling time-sensitive data and high volumes of information. Tools such as Apache Kafka and Apache Flink are commonly used to manage data flows and enable real-time analytics.\n\n\n\nData quality management is the process of ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and consistent. High-quality data is critical for reliable analysis, although maintaining such quality requires ongoing monitoring and may be resource-intensive.\n\n\n\nETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load and describes the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a standard format, and loading it into a target system for analysis. This approach supports data consolidation but also poses challenges in maintaining transformation accuracy and managing diverse data sources.",

It is designed to support the creation and maintenance of data hubs and portals, offering a standardised platform for publishing and accessing datasets. CKAN employs a PostgreSQL database, a Solr index, and a comprehensive API to facilitate data discovery and integration (see its GitHub repository for more technical information). It has been deployed widely in national and local government open data portals (for example, data.gov.uk and data.gov), as well as by various international organisations\n\n\nPiveau\nPiveau is an open data platform comprising several integrated components that focus on the management and integration of open data, with a particular emphasis on metadata management, data harmonisation, and linked data capabilities (Kirstein et al., 2020). It supports a wide range of data protocols and formats—including OAI-PMH, RDF, CKAN, uData, OwnCloud, JSON, SPARQL, Socrata, and Drupal—allowing for dynamic, programmable data transformation using JavaScript or XSLT. Harvesting processes can be individually scheduled, and the platform provides export capabilities into DCAT(-AP) and related standards.\nKey features include:\n\nData Acquisition and Transformation:\nPiveau supports scalable harvesting (up to hundreds of thousands of datasets per source) and flexible, configuration-based orchestration, enabling custom processing steps and integration with third-party services.\nLinked Data and Storage:\nIt stores DCAT metadata as RDF in a triplestore and utilises URI harmonisation to create a consistent knowledge graph. The platform also integrates external vocabularies and ontologies to enhance linked data capabilities.\nSearch and Frontend:\nA powerful search engine based on Elasticsearch and a rich, customisable, multilingual frontend allow users to efficiently search and filter metadata. Additionally, extensive backend tools facilitate the creation and management of metadata.\nQuality Assurance:\nPiveau periodically generates quality assessments based on SHACL validations. These assessments are stored alongside the metadata using the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV), with reports available in various formats.\nAccess Control and Operations:\nIntegration with Keycloak provides robust identity and access management, while containerisation with Docker and support for Kubernetes (with ready-to-use Helm charts) ensure efficient operations. The backends are primarily written in Java and Kotlin (using the Vert.x framework), and the frontends are developed with Vue.js.\n\nPiveau is open source and its code is available on GitLab. Below is an overview of its architecture.\n\nhttps://doc.piveau.io/general/basic-architecture/\n\n\nEntryScape\nEntryScape is an information management platform developed by Metasolutions to handle complex datasets through semantic integration and linked data principles (Ebner & Palmér, 2014). It facilitates the organisation and enrichment of heterogeneous data sources, making it easier to create interoperable and semantically rich datasets.\nIts customers include a broad range of public organisations such as municipalities, regional authorities, and national agencies. For example, in Sweden, EntryScape is used by national agencies like Skatteverket or Riksarkivet. Further information is available on the EntryScape website and via its repository on Bitbucket.\n\n\nuData\nuData is an open data management platform developed by the Open Data Team. It aims to simplify the publication and management of data, offering a user-friendly interface that makes it accessible for both data providers and users. uData is often employed by municipalities and local governments to publish open data portals, and its modular architecture allows for easy integration with existing IT infrastructures. The source code is available on its GitHub repository.\n\n\nOpenRefine\nOpenRefine is an open source tool for data cleaning and transformation. Initially released in 2010 (originally as Freebase Gridworks, later renamed Google Refine), it operates as a local web application designed to help users clean messy data, standardise formats, and reconcile datasets. It supports various data formats (including CSV, TSV, JSON, and XML) and allows for advanced data manipulation using scripting languages such as GREL and Jython. For more details, see the GitHub repository.\n\n\nLOMAS\nLOMAS is an open source platform developed by the Data Science Competence Center (DSCC) of the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Public services collect large volumes of data, yet strict privacy regulations often limit their secondary use. LOMAS addresses this challenge by enabling authorised users—such as approved researchers and government analysts—to execute algorithms on sensitive datasets without directly accessing the data. Instead, users submit algorithms to the platform, which then processes the data within a secure, trusted computing environment. The results are returned protected by Differential Privacy, a framework that introduces controlled noise to prevent the extraction of identifiable information. This approach allows for the quantification and control of disclosure risk while ensuring transparency about data protection (see Aymon et al., 2024).",

    "text": "Open Research Data (ORD)\n\nDefinition\n\nResearch data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modeling, interview, or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence Concordat Working Group (2016).\n\n\n\nFor Funding Agencies (and Institutions)\n\nFor the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications, and consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice.\n\n\n\nFor Organizations that Supply Metrics\n\nBe open and transparent by providing data and methods used to calculate all metrics.\n\nProvide the data under a licence that allows unrestricted reuse, and provide computational access to data, where possible.\n\nSan Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA)\n\n\nORD in Switzerland\n\nSNSF Policy\nThe Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) expects all its funded researchers:\n\nto store the research data they have worked on and produced during the course of their research work,\nto share these data with other researchers, unless they are bound by legal, ethical, copyright, confidentiality or other clauses, and\nto deposit their data and metadata onto existing public repositories in formats that anyone can find, access and reuse without restriction.\n\nhttps://www.snf.ch/en/dMILj9t4LNk8NwyR/topic/open-research-data\n\n\nVision\n\nBy facilitating access to and reuse of research data, ORD promotes better, more effective, and more impactful research for the benefit of society as a whole. Through the principles of open access and reusability of research data, ORD practices support transparent and reproducible research findings. Moreover, ORD fosters collaboration by promoting exchange among researchers across disciplines, legal systems and national borders, thus enabling creativity and innovation to thrive (Open Science Delegation, 2021a).\n\n\n\nAction Areas\nThe SNSF has identified four criteria in the action plan (Open Science Delegation, 2021b):\n\nSupport researchers and research communities in imagining and adopting ORD practices\nDevelopment, promotion, and maintenance of financially sustainable basic infrastructures and services for all researchers\nEquipping researchers for ORD skills development and exchange of best practices\nBuilding up systemic und supportive conditions for institutions and research communities\n\n→ for more information, see Wiel et al. (2024)\n\n\n\nResearch Data Management (RDM)\n\nDefinition\nRDM refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project.\n\n\nPurpose\nRDM ensures that research data are well-organised, maintained and accessible for current and future research, thereby improving their reliability, validity and reproducibility.\n\n\n\nData Management Plan (DMP)\n\nDefinition\nA DMP is a formal document that outlines how data will be handled during and after a research project, covering aspects from collection to sharing and preservation.\n\n\nPurpose\nIt serves as a guide for managing data efficiently and meets funding agency requirements for data stewardship. It is now mandatory for most funding agencies to require a DMP as part of the grant application process to secure funding. University libraries often have services and resources to assist researchers in creating these documents, providing expert guidance on best practices in data management.\n\n\n\nRDM and DMP\n\nInterconnected Roles\nRDM encompasses the day-to-day management of research data, while a DMP provides a structured plan for how to manage, share, and preserve data throughout the research project.\n\n\nPlanning and Execution\nA DMP is essentially a blueprint for RDM. It outlines the policies and standards to be applied to the data, ensuring that data management practices are thought through from the outset of the project.\n\n\n\nOpen Governement Data (OGD)\n\nDefinition\n\nThe work of government involves collecting huge amounts of data, much of which is not confidential (economic data, demographic data, spending data, crime data, transport data, etc). The value of much of this data can be greatly enhanced by releasing it as open data, freeing it for re-use by business, research, civil society, data journalists, etc Open Knowledge (2016).\n\nhttps://opendatahandbook.org/glossary/en/terms/government-data/\n\n\n\nOGD in Switzerland\n\nhttps://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/services/ogd/masterplan.html\n\nLMETA.

It is by definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work. It is ready-to-hand. This image holds up well enough for many purposes – turn on the faucet for a drink of water and you use a vast infrastructure of plumbing and water regulation without usually thinking much about it (Star, 1999).\n\n\n\nDimensions\nAccording to Star (1999), infrastructure can be understood through nine interconnected dimensions:\n\nEmbeddedness: Infrastructure is sunk into and inside of other structures, social arrangements, and technologies. People do not necessarily distinguish the several coordinated aspects of infrastructure.\nTransparency: Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense that it does not have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each task, but invisibly supports those tasks.\nReach or scope: This may be either spatial or temporal – infrastructure has reach beyond a single event or one-site practice.\nLearned as part of membership: Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be learned about. New participants acquire a naturalised familiarity with its objects, as they become members.\nLinks with conventions of practice: Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice.\nEmbodiment of standards: Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures and tools in a standardised fashion.\nBuilt on an installed base: Infrastructure does not grow de novo; it wrestles with the inertia of the installed base and inherits strengths and limitations from that base.\nBecomes visible upon breakdown: The normally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout.\nIs fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally: Because infrastructure is big, layered, and complex, and because it means different things locally, it is never changed from above. Changes take time and negotiations, and adjustment with other aspects of the systems are involved.\n\n\n\n\nText-based formats\n\nPlain Text (TXT)\nWSe2            WS2         MoS2    \n\ndk  Intensity   dk  Intensity   dk  Intensity   \n\n855.87628   63  848.96433   -39 855.87628   372\n855.25787   72.25   848.34546   2   855.25787   424\n854.63942   64.25   847.72654   -39 854.63942   460\n854.02093   58  847.10759   -37 854.02093   362\n853.40239   66  846.4886    -28 853.40239   440\nSohier, T., Ponomarev, E., Gibertini, M., Berger, H., Marzari, N., Ubrig, N., & Morpurgo, A.

It enhances usability by making data more accessible and understandable to a wide range of users, including non-experts and developers. Well-documented data fosters trust by providing transparency about sources, methodologies, and underlying code, while also supporting data integration and application development by enabling seamless combination of data from diverse sources. Below are key types of documentation that contribute to these goals:\n\nData field descriptions/data models\nUser guides\nMetadata\nDeveloper documentation\nSource code documentation\n\n\n\n\nProtocols\nA robust set of rules and standards governs the exchange and accessibility of open data over the internet. These protocols and mechanisms enable accessibility by facilitating standardised and straightforward access to data, which is essential for promoting innovation and transparency. Additionally, they support interoperability, ensuring that data from diverse sources can be efficiently integrated and used together. Below are key technologies and protocols that achieve these goals:\n\nApplication Programming Interface (API): mechanism that enable two software components to communicate with each other\n\nRepresentational State Transfer (REST): a style of API that uses HTTP requests for communication. REST is stateless, i.e. each request from a client to the server is treated as new. There is no stored memory of previous interactions. This means the server does not store any state about the client session on the server side.\nSimple Object Access Protocol (SOAP): a protocol used for exchanging structured information in web services, offering high security and transactional reliability. SOAP can support both stateless and stateful operations.\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP): used for the transfer of data files, particularly large datasets, from one host to another.\nOpen Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH): a protocol for harvesting metadata descriptions of records in an archive, particularly used in digital libraries.\nReally Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary (RSS) / Atom Feeds: used for regularly updating or publishing data that changes frequently. Feeds enable publishers to syndicate data automatically.\nSPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL): used for querying and manipulating RDF",

    "text": "Linked (Open) (Usable) Data\n\nAn Open Vision of the Web\n\nThe [World Wide Web] project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system. The project started with the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone.\n\nBerners-Lee (1991)\n\n\nLinked Data\nLinked Data refers to a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF, and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and queried.\n\n\nLinked Data Principles\n\nUse Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as names for things\nUse HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.\nWhen someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (e.g. RDF, RDFS, SPARQL, etc.)\nInclude links to other URIs so that they can discover more things.\n\nBerners-Lee (2006)\n\n\nLinked Open Data (LOD)\nLinked Open Data is a subset of Linked Data that is open, meaning it is freely accessible and reusable by anyone. It adheres to the principles of being accessible under an open license, available in a machine-readable format, using open standards from the W3C (such as RDF and SPARQL), and linked to other datasets to increase its utility.\n\n5-star deployment scheme for Open Data: https://5stardata.info/\n\n\nThe Semantic Web or the Web of Data\nThe Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web, through standards, to make it machine-readable.\n\nIdehen (2017)\n\n\nResource Description Framework (RDF)\nWith RDF, everything goes in threes. Most of the triples’ components have Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).  Syntax: subject, predicate, object \\((s \\ \\vec{p} \\ o)\\)\n\nWith RDF, everything goes in threes, the data model contains so-called triples: that is subject, predicate, object that form graphs. Most of the components of these triples use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and are generally web-addressable, whether for naming subjects and objects (which may themselves also be objects of other triples) or relationships\n\n\nLinked Open Usable Data (LOUD)\nThe concept of LOUD extends LOD by emphasising not just the openness and interlinking of data but also its usability.\n\nThe term was coined by Robert Sanderson (2018, 2019) who has been involved in the conception and maintenance of web standards, mainly in the cultural heritage field.\nLOUD’s goal is to achieve the Semantic Web’s intent on a global scale in a usable fashion by leveraging community-driven and JSON-LD-based specifications.\nIt has five main design principles to make the data more easily accessible to software developers, who play a key role in interacting with the data and building software and services on top of it, and to some extent to academics.\n\n\nLOUD Design Principles\n\nThe right Abstraction for the audience\nFew Barriers to entry\nComprehensible by introspection\nDocumentation with working examples\nFew Exceptions, instead many consistent patterns\n\nhttps://linked.art/loud/\n\n\nLOUD Standards/Communities\n\nInternational Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)\nW3C Web Annotation Data Model\nLinked Art\n\nThe IIIF and Linked Art communities are built on a synergy of social and technical integration, with a strong focus on usability. They are unified by shared expertise and leadership, fostering collaboration across technical boundaries. These communities prioritise inclusivity and diversity of participation, ensuring that a wide range of perspectives contribute to their work. Openness and friendliness are core values, along with a strong commitment to transparency in processes and decision-making. To facilitate engagement and knowledge sharing, they organise both online and face-to-face meetings to strengthen connections across the community.\n(see Newbury, 2018; Raemy, 2023)\n\nInternational Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)\n\nA model for presenting and annotating content\nA global community that develops shared application programming interfaces (APIs), implements them in software, and exposes interoperable content\n\nSnydman et al.

The URI can specify the region, size, rotation, quality characteristics and format of the requested image.\n\n\nPresentation API\nThe IIIF Presentation API provides the information necessary to allow a rich, online viewing environment for compound digital objects to be presented to a human user, often in conjunction with the IIIF Image API.\n\n\nAuthorization Flow API\nThe IIIF Authorization Flow specification describes a set of workflows for guiding the user through an existing access control system.\n\n\nChange Discovery API\nThe IIIF Change Discovery API provides the information needed to discover and make use of IIIF resources.\n\n\nContent Search API\nThe IIIF Content Search API specification lays out the interoperability mechanism for performing searches of text annotations associated with an object within the IIIF context.\n\n\nContent State API\nThe IIIF Content State API provides a way to refer to a IIIF Presentation API resource, or a part of a resource, in a compact format that can be used to initialize the view of that resource in any client.\n\n\n\nhttps://iiif.io/api\nThe Image and Presentation APIs are referred to as the core IIIF APIs\n\nIIIF Image API\n\n\n\n\nType\nSyntax\nExample\n\n\n\n\nBase URI\n{scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}\nhttps://iiif.dasch.swiss/0812/276uIbjSulF-k5RrtYZ3LUA.jpx\n\n\nImage Request\n{$BASE}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}.{format}\nhttps://iiif.dasch.swiss/0812/276uIbjSulF-k5RrtYZ3LUA.jpx/full/1000,/0/default.jpg\n\n\nImage Information (Metadata)\n{$BASE}/info.json\nhttps://iiif.dasch.swiss/0812/276uIbjSulF-k5RrtYZ3LUA.jpx/info.json\n\n\n\nIIIF Presentation API\nPresentation API Data Model\n\nMain types\n\nManifest\n{\n  \"@context\": \"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json\",\n  \"id\": \"https://manifests.collections.yale.edu/yuag/obj/293797\",\n  \"type\": \"Manifest\",\n  \"label\": {\n    \"en\": [\n      \"Simon de Vlieger, Fisherfolk and Other Figures on a Beach, 1642\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"metadata\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Copyright Statement\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Public Domain\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Title\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Fisherfolk and Other Figures on a Beach\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Creator(s)\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Artist: Simon de Vlieger (Dutch, 1601–1653)\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Culture\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Dutch\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Date\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"1642\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Medium\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Oil on panel\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"label\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"Dimensions\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"en\": [\n          \"32 1/8 × 52 13/16 in.

It supports a wide range of use cases, from simple annotations to linking content with multimedia data points. It leverages JSON-LD for serialization, enabling integration with the web’s structured data ecosystem while following Linked Data principles (see Haslhofer et al., 2011; Sanderson et al., 2013).\nThe model follows a three-part structure: - Target: The resource being annotated. - Body: The annotation content (text, image, media, etc.). - Annotation: The entity linking the body and target.\nThis model ensures compatibility with web architecture and facilitates cross-platform sharing of annotations.\n\nThe Web Annotation Data Model in a IIIF setting\n{\n  \"@context\": \"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json\",\n  \"id\": \"https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/annotations/SGV_12N_08589-p1-list.json\",\n  \"type\": \"AnnotationPage\",\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld\",\n      \"id\": \"https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/annotations/SGV_12N_08589-p1-list/annotation-436121.json\",\n      \"motivation\": \"commenting\",\n      \"type\": \"Annotation\",\n      \"body\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"TextualBody\",\n          \"value\": \"person\",\n          \"purpose\": \"commenting\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"TextualBody\",\n          \"value\": \"Object Detection (vitrivr)\",\n          \"purpose\": \"tagging\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"TextualBody\",\n          \"value\": \"&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Detection score: 0.9574&lt;/small&gt;\",\n          \"purpose\": \"commenting\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"target\": {\n        \"source\": \"https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/SGV_12N_08589/canvas/p1\",\n        \"selector\": {\n          \"type\": \"FragmentSelector\",\n          \"conformsTo\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/\",\n          \"value\": \"xywh=319,2942,463,523\"\n        },\n        \"dcterms:isPartOf\": {\n          \"type\": \"Manifest\",\n          \"id\": \"https://iiif.participatory-archives.ch/SGV_12N_08589/manifest.json\"\n        }}},\n\n\nLinked Art\nLinked Art is a community and a CIDOC (ICOM International Committee for Documentation) Working Group collaborating to define a metadata application profile for describing cultural heritage, and the technical means for conveniently interacting with it (the API).\nhttps://linked.art\n\nCommunity\nLinked Art is an open community initiative where participants collaborate under a shared code of conduct. Ways to engage include attending events, joining the discussion group, participating in the Slack workspace, or contributing to discussions on GitHub.\nA wide range of institutions contribute to Linked Art, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, Yale University, Smithsonian Institution, Europeana, Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN), Oxford University, Victoria and Albert Museum, Rijksmuseum, The Frick Collection, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), and many more. Since 2019, an editorial board has overseen Linked Art, ensuring diverse representation across institutions and disciplines.\n\n\nData Model\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nLinked Art\n\n\n\n\nConceptual Model\nCIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)\n\n\nOntology\nRDF encoding of CRM 7.1, plus extensions\n\n\nVocabulary\nGetty Vocabularies, mainly the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), as well as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) and the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)\n\n\nProfile\nObject-based cultural heritage (mainly art museum oriented)\n\n\nAPI\nJSON-LD 1.1, following REST (representational state transfer) and web patterns\n\n\n\nLinked Art from 50k feet\n\nRaemy et al.

    "text": "Open Source / Free Software / F(L)OSS\n\nDefinition and Philosophy\nOpen Source refers to software with source code that can be inspected, modified, and enhanced by anyone. It emphasises collaboration and community-oriented development.\n\n\nKey Characteristics\nIt includes free redistribution, access to source code, and allowance for derived works.\n\n\nCriteria\n\nFree redistribution\nSource code must be included\nDerived works must be allowed\nIntegrity of the author’s source code\nNo discrimation against persons or groups\nNo discrimation against fields of endeavour\nDistribution of licence\nLicence must not be specific to a product\nLicence must not restrict other software\nLicence must be technology-neutral\n\nhttps://opensource.org/osd/\n\n\nFree Software\nFree Software is centred around the idea of user freedom – the freedom to run, study, change, and distribute the software. “Free” refers to freedom, not price.\nIt has four essential freedoms: 1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0). 2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2). 4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.\n\n“Free software” means software that respects users’ freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html\n\n\nFree/Libre and Open Source Software\n\nThis is software for which the licensee can get the source code, and is allowed to modify this code and to redistribute the software and the modifications. Many terms are used: free, referring to the freedom to use (not to “free of charge”), libre, which is the French translation of Free/freedom, and which is preferred by some writers to avoid the ambiguous reference to free of charge, and open source, which focuses more on the access to the sources than on the freedom to redistribute. In practice, the differences are not great, and more and more scholars are choosing the term FLOSS to name this whole movement.\n\nJullien (2009)\n“Neutral stance”: See https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html",

He currently works as a Data Scientist and Project Manager for LINDASnext at the Swiss Federal Archives.\nHe holds a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Information Science from the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland. He completed his PhD in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel in 2024, with a dissertation titled Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage: Perspectives on Community Practices and Semantic Interoperability. His research examines how cultural heritage institutions can better share their digital collections through LOUD standards, particularly focusing on the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and Linked Art specifications. Through analysis of the PIA research project and Yale’s Collections Discovery platform, his work investigates both the social dynamics of communities developing these standards and the technical challenges of making cultural data more interoperable.\nJulien A. Raemy has worked extensively in academia and in or for the cultural heritage domain, including as a Photo Archivist for the Montreux Jazz Digital Project at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) from 2015 to 2017, as a Research and Teaching Assistant at the Haute école de gestion de Genève (HEG-GE) from 2017 to 2021, and as an Interoperability Specialist at DaSCH, Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanities, from 2021 to 2024.
