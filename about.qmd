## About this Website 

This is the third iteration of the *Introduction to Open Data* course and the second in website format. Originally created as a Markdown-based presentation [@raemyIntroductionOpenData2024], the course was first adapted into a website and now continues to evolve. While the core content from the original presentation remains valuable, this version introduces a restructured approach to hopefully better serve learners' needs. 

This Quarto-based site maintains essential concepts while offering improved layout, accessibility, and the capacity for ongoing refinement as the open data landscape develops.
