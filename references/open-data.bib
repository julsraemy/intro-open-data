  abstract = {Sharing data across scientific domains is often impeded by differences in the language used to describe data and metadata.\&nbsp; We argue that disagreements over the boundary between data and metadata are a common source of confusion.\&nbsp; Information appearing as data in one domain may be considered metadata in another domain, a process that we call “semantic transposition.”\&nbsp; To promote greater understanding, we develop new terminology for describing how data and metadata are structured, and we show how it can be applied to a variety of widely used data formats.\&nbsp; Our approach builds upon previous work, such as the Observations and Measurements (ISO 19156) data model. We rely on tools from the Data Documentation Initiative’s Cross Domain Integration (DDI-CDI) to illustrate how the same data can be represented in different ways, and how information considered data in one format can become metadata in another format.},

  abstract = {Public services collect massive volumes of data to fulfill their missions. These data fuel the generation of regional, national, and international statistics across various sectors. However, their immense potential remains largely untapped due to strict and legitimate privacy regulations. In this context, Lomas is a novel open-source platform designed to realize the full potential of the data held by public administrations. It enables authorized users, such as approved researchers and government analysts, to execute algorithms on confidential datasets without directly accessing the data. The Lomas platform is designed to operate within a trusted computing environment, such as governmental IT infrastructure. Authorized users access the platform remotely to submit their algorithms for execution on private datasets. Lomas executes these algorithms without revealing the data to the user and returns the results protected by Differential Privacy, a framework that introduces controlled noise to the results, rendering any attempt to extract identifiable information unreliable. Differential Privacy allows for the mathematical quantification and control of the risk of disclosure while allowing for a complete transparency regarding how data is protected and utilized. The contributions of this project will significantly transform how data held by public services are used, unlocking valuable insights from previously inaccessible data. Lomas empowers research, informing policy development, e.g., public health interventions, and driving innovation across sectors, all while upholding the highest data confidentiality standards.},

  abstract = {The Call for the STI Conference held in September 2024, in Berlin, argues that there is a variety of processes of openness among different communities and stakeholders which pose questions about the interaction of openness and closedness. It stimulates the participants to ask how much closedness is embedded in openness and vice versa and how to measure these intertwined phenomena. This keynote has been framed in these basic concerns and intends to advance towards the intersection with inclusiveness, considering that openness is necessary but not sufficient to achieve a more equitable and effective scholarly communication globally. In the convergence of field approach and structural heterogeneity, we build a conceptual framework to assess the combinations observed in the space of open science, and the stakeholders that represent forces towards inclusiveness or exclusiveness. Exploring the main indicators of inclusive openness, 7 cartographies are proposed for a global mapping and the discussion of the main issues at stake towards a just transition to open science: 1) a comparison between the distribution by country of repositories of published output and primary data repositories, 2) a mapping of the Current Information systems (CRIS) and their different developments at the national and institutional level, 3) a cartography of persistent identifiers of digital resources comparing DOI and ARK, 4) a cartography of persistent identifiers for\&nbsp; active researchers (ORCID) by country and its weak representation of the national research communities, 5) a comparison of the coverage of identifiers of research organizations (ROR) with a national database of organizations, 6) a cartography of indexed journals with no-fee for publishing or reading and 7) a mapping of multilingualism in scholarly publishing, by platform. Finally, some study cases are discussed to show examples of the limited inclusiveness of the current state of open infrastructures and publishing platforms.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to offer a checklist that can be used for both creating and evaluating digital collections, which are also sometimes referred to as data sets as part of the collections as data movement, suitable for computational use. Design/methodology/approach The checklist was built by synthesising and analysing the results of relevant research literature, articles and studies and the issues and needs obtained in an observational study. The checklist was tested and applied both as a tool for assessing a selection of digital collections made available by galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) institutions as proof of concept and as a supporting tool for creating collections as data. Findings Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in making available digital collections published by GLAM organisations for computational use. Based on previous work, the authors defined a methodology to build a checklist for the publication of Collections as data. The authors’ evaluation showed several examples of applications that can be useful to encourage other institutions to publish their digital collections for computational use. Originality/value While some work on making available digital collections suitable for computational use exists, giving particular attention to data quality, planning and experimentation, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of the work to date provides an easy-to-follow and robust checklist to publish collection data sets in GLAM institutions. This checklist intends to encourage small- and medium-sized institutions to adopt the collection as data principles in daily workflows following best practices and guidelines.},

The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the Research Data Alliance) is a network of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the ‘CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance’ (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organizations, and governments. The CARE Principles are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’ (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The CARE Principles build upon earlier work by the Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data Sovereignty Network, US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network, Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective, and numerous Indigenous Peoples, nations, and communities. The goal is that stewards and other users of Indigenous data will ‘Be FAIR and CARE.’ In this first formal publication of the CARE Principles, we articulate their rationale, describe their relation to the FAIR Principles, and present examples of their application.},

Descartes is famous for his system of axes, and Wittgenstein for his first design of truth table diagrams. Today, visualisation is a form of ‘computer-aided seeing’ information in data. Hence, information is the fundamental ‘currency’ exchanged through a visualisation pipeline. In this article, we examine the types of information that may occur at different stages of a general visualization pipeline. We do so from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. The quantitative analysis is developed on the basis of Shannon’s information theory. The qualitative analysis is developed on the basis of Floridi’s taxonomy in the philosophy of information. We then discuss in detail how the condition of the ‘data processing inequality’ can be broken in a visualisation pipeline. This theoretic finding underlines the usefulness and importance of visualisation in dealing with the increasing problem of data deluge. We show that the subject of visualisation should be studied using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, preferably in an interdisciplinary synergy between information theory and the philosophy of information.},

The aim is not only to seek more information but to find new approaches of understanding the way in which people’s memory relate to the collective, public form of archival memory and ultimately how users figure in and shape the digital archive. We provide a proof-of-concept workflow based on automatically generated annotations comprising 53,481 photos that were subjected to object detection using Faster R-{CNN} Inception {ResNet} V2. Of the detected objects, 184,609 have a detection score greater than 0.5, 123,529 have a score greater than 0.75, and 88,442 have a score greater than 0.9. A threshold of 0.75 was set for the dissemination of our annotations, compatible with the W3C Web Annotation Data Model ({WADM}) and embedded in our {IIIF} Manifests. In the near future, the workflow will be upgraded to allow for the co-existence of various, and occasionally conflicting, assertions made by both human and machine users.

Federated and reproducible queries are conducted using the Wikidata SPARQL public endpoint and three institutional LOD repositories on Jupyter Notebooks. The data are exported in a format compatible with computational tools (e.g., CSV) by focusing on works of a single author or works from a specific movement.

  abstract = {Annotations allow users to associate additional information with existing resources. Using proprietary and closed systems on the Web, users are already able to annotate multimedia resources such as images, audio and video. So far, however, this information is almost always kept locked up and inaccessible to the Web of Data. We believe that an important step to take is the integration of multimedia annotations and the Linked Data principles. This should allow clients to easily publish and consume, thus exchange annotations about resources via commonWeb standards.We first present the current status of the Open Annotation Collaboration, an international initiative that is currently working on annotation interoperability specifications based on best practices from the Linked Data effort. Then we present two use cases and early prototypes that make use of the proposed annotation model and present lessons learned and discuss yet open technical issues.},

  abstract = {Whatever its name, Free/Libre or Open Source Software (FLOSS), diffusion represents one of the main evolutions of the Information Technology (IT) industry in recent years. Operating System Linux, or Web server Apache (more than 60\% market share on its market), database MySQL or PHP languages are some examples of broadly-used FLOSS programs. One of the most original characteristics of this movement is its collective, cooperative software development organization in which a growing number of firms is involved (some figures in Lakhani \& Wolf (2005)). Of course, programs, because they are codified information, are quite easy to exchange, and make the cooperation easier than in other industries. But, as pointed out by Stallman (1998), if sharing pieces of software within firms was a dominant practice in the 1950’s, it declined in the 1970’s, and almost disappeared in the 1980’s, before regaining and booming today. This article aims at explaining the evolution (and the comeback) of a cooperative, non-market production. In the first part, we explain the decrease of cooperation as a consequence of the evolution of the computer users, of their demand, and of the industrial organization constructed to meet this demand. This theoretical and historical framework is used in the second part to understand the renewal of a cooperative organization, the FLOSS phenomenon, first among computer-literate users, and then within the industry.},

  abstract = {Open access (OA) in the Global North is considered to solve an accessibility problem in scholarly communication. But this accessibility is restricted to the consumption of knowledge. Epistemic injustices inhering in the scholarly communication of a global production of knowledge remain unchanged. This underscores that the commercial or big deal OA dominating Europe and North America have little revolutionary potential to democratise knowledge. Academia in the Global North, driven by politics of progressive neoliberalism, can even reinforce its hegemonic power by solidifying and legitimating contemporary hierarchies of scholarly communication through OA. In a critique of the notion of a democratisation of knowledge, I showcase manifestations of OA as either allowing consumption of existing discourse or as active participation of discourse in the making. The latter comes closer to being the basis for a democratisation of knowledge. I discuss this as I issue a threefold conceptualisation of epistemic injustices comprising of testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice, and epistemic objectification. As these injustices prevail, the notion of a democratisation of knowledge through OA is but another form of technological determinism that neglects the intricacies of culture and hegemony.},

  abstract = {Open science refers to both the practices and norms of more open and transparent communication and research in scientific disciplines and the discourse on these practices and norms. There is no such discourse dedicated to the humanities. Though the humanities appear to be less coherent as a cluster of scholarship than the sciences are, they do share unique characteristics which lead to distinct scholarly communication and research practices. A discourse on making these practices more open and transparent needs to take account of these characteristics. The prevalent scientific perspective in the discourse on more open practices does not do so, which confirms that the discourse’s name, open science, indeed excludes the humanities so that talking about open science in the humanities is incoherent. In this paper, I argue that there needs to be a dedicated discourse for more open research and communication practices in the humanities, one that integrates several elements currently fragmented into smaller, unconnected discourses (such as on open access, preprints, or peer review). I discuss three essential elements of open science—preprints, open peer review practices, and liberal open licences—in the realm of the humanities to demonstrate why a dedicated open humanities discourse is required.},

An updated statement was~needed in light of increased community implementation of collections as data in context of an ever more complex data landscape.~ The Vancouver Statement suggests a set of principles for thinking through questions that collections-as-data work produces, as part of an expanding global, interprofessional, and interdisciplinary effort to empower memory, knowledge, and data stewards (e.g., practitioners and scholars) who aim to support responsible development and computational use of collections as data. This stewardship role only grows in importance as artificial intelligence applications, trained on vast amounts of data, including collections as data, impact our lives ever more pervasively. The Vancouver Statement is the product of diverse contributions from the participants of the working event,~Collections as Data: State of the Field and Future Directions,~held April 25-26, 2023 at Internet Archive Canada in addition to asynchronous community feedback. Professional translation of the Vancouver Statement was provided by Transolution.~Special thanks go to Gimena del Rio Riande and Gaëlle Béquet for additional review of statement translations.},

We begin by exploring the significant advances made by the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) in promoting interoperability for image-based resources. The principles and practices of IIIF have paved the way for Linked Art, which expands the use of linked data by demonstrating how it can easily facilitate the integration and sharing of semantic cultural heritage data across portals and institutions. To provide a practical demonstration of the concepts discussed, the chapter highlights the implementation of LUX, the Yale Collections Discovery platform. LUX serves as a compelling case study for the use of linked data at scale, demonstrating the real-world application of automated enrichment in the cultural heritage domain. Rooted in empirical study, the analysis presented in this chapter delves into the broader context of community practices and semantic interoperability. By examining the collaborative efforts and integration of diverse cultural heritage resources, the research sheds light on the potential benefits and challenges associated with LOUD.},

Motivation PIA, led by the University of Basel and the Bern Academy of the Arts, aims to encourage participation from scholars and the wider public through three collections from the photographic archives of the Swiss Society for Folklore Studies (SSFS): The Atlas of Swiss Folklore, Ernst Brunner, and~Kreis Family. PIA aims to create multiple interfaces reflecting diverse perspectives by deploying community-developed LOUD~specifications such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)~and Linked Art, an RDF application profile (JSON-LD) based on CIDOC-CRM to describe object-based cultural heritage. In collaboration with the University of Oxford via the Linked Art II project, PIA has transformed their cultural heritage collection data into Linked Art using templates, which encapsulate the data characteristics and cataloguing practices.~ A Linked Art API will provide an additional entry point, as a means of conveying semantically enriched events and as a benchmark against other collections leveraging this model. Python-based Workflow To generate Linked Art files for the combined PIA collection a data transformation workflow has been created through which PIA templates were encoded in Python for a given Linked Art API entity endpoint, currently: DigitalObject HumanMadeObject and Set. The workflow, described in a use case example with a photograph from the Ernst Brunner collection, provides a three-step software process for transforming data into Linked Art. Query: The first Python script extracts collection data from the (legacy) PIA JSON API. YAML front matters are used for script variables. The filepath for the relevant .yaml~file is specified as a script argument throughout the workflow. For our example, the script queried data for all images looking for DigitalObject entities (one of the variables) and the object's metadata that are stored come specifically from https://json.participatory-archives.ch/api/v1/images/12033\} Map: Templates are used to map collection data to an intermediate JSON data format. The intermediate JSON data format means that the later transformation script that creates Linked Art JSON-LD does not necessarily need to be modified if a new data source is introduced. Transform:~The intermediate JSON data format is transformed to Linked Art with Python functions that define ‘patterns’ (for example classified\_as) for representing different aspects of photographic collection data as Linked Art. Future Work The SSFS will migrate its database into the DaSCH Service Platform (DSP) and amend their data model which will affect PIA, requiring an upgrade of its infrastructure and APIs. The workflow for creating Linked Art representations will have to be reconfigured and repurposed with different data sources. After the migration of the SSFS database, the PIA team will investigate remaining issues in the GitHub repository regarding the correct mapping of Linked Art entities and attribution of IDs. The team will work to ensure that the appropriate Linked Art modelling is achieved through the workflow. Conclusion The reconfigurable Python-based workflow is able to transform cultural heritage data, initially photographic collections, into LOUD, as a foundation for varied participatory interfaces supporting scholarship and beyond. The adaptability and extensibility of the workflow allows for potential future transformations of data from other collections to Linked Art.

  abstract = {Digital technologies have fundamentally transformed the ways in which Cultural Heritage (CH) collections are accessed and engaged with. Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) specifications, including the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Presentation API 3.0, Linked Art, and the Web Annotation Data Model (WADM), have emerged as web standards to facilitate the description and dissemination of these valuable resources. Despite the widespread adoption of IIIF, the implementation of LOUD specifications, especially in combination, remains challenging. This is particularly true in the development and assessment of infrastructures, or sites of assemblage, that support these standards. The research is guided by two perspectives, namely community practices and semantic interoperability. The former aims to assess how organisations, individuals, and apparatuses engage with and contribute to the consensus-making processes surrounding LOUD. By examining community practices, the social fabrics of the LOUD ecosystem can be better understood. The latter perspective explores how data can be made meaningful to machines in a standardised and interoperable approach that promotes the exchange of well-formed information. This work is grounded as part of the SNSF-funded research project Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) (2021-2025), which aims to develop a citizen science platform around three photographic collections from the Cultural Anthropology Switzerland (CAS) archives. The theoretical framework is firmly rooted in Actor-Network Theory (ANT), as one of the aims of the thesis is to describe the collaborative structures of the LOUD ecosystem and to highlight the importance of non-human actors. Beyond the implementation of LOUD standards within the PIA research project, the empirical research includes an analysis of the social fabrics of the IIIF and Linked Art communities, as well as an investigation of LUX, Yale Collections Discovery platform. The research aims to identify the socio-technical requirements for developing specifications consistent with LOUD design principles. It also seeks to understand how the implementation of LOUD standards within PIA contributes to recognising their potential benefits and limitations in terms of facilitating data reuse and wider participation. The thesis further examines the implementation strategies, challenges, and outcomes of Yale University’s large-scale deployment of LOUD standards, focusing on how ensuring the consistency of Linked Art and IIIF resources within the LUX platform contributes to the CH domain. The core methodology of this thesis is an actor- and practice-centred inquiry, focusing on the detailed examination of specific cosmologies within LOUD-driven communities, PIA, and LUX. This approach aims to unravel the intricate web of cultural processes and constellations through a micro-perspective, rich in empirical evidence. Key empirical findings indicate that LOUD improves the discoverability and integration of data in CH, which requires community-driven consensus on model interoperability. Significant challenges include engaging marginalised groups, sustaining long-term engagement, and balancing technological and social considerations. The strategic use of technology and the capture of digital materiality are critical, yet LOUD presents challenges in terms of resource investment, data consistency, and the wider implementation of complex patterns. LOUD should clearly lead efforts to improve the accessibility and usability of CH data. The community-driven methodology of IIIF and Linked Art inherently promotes collaboration and transparency, making these standards critical tools in the ongoing evolution of data management. Even for projects and institutions that do not adopt these specifications, LOUD's socio-technical practices provide crucial insights into effective digital stewardship and community engagement strategies.},

It shares key findings from my PhD thesis on Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) for cultural heritage. My research examined how LOUD specifications like IIIF APIs and Linked Art fostered collaborative knowledge creation, focusing on implementations in both the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) project and Yale's LUX platform. Using a framework based on Actor-Network Theory (ANT), the analysis revealed three critical dimensions. First, sustainable development required continuous engagement beyond implementation, with community-led practices providing the socio-technical foundation for specification maintenance. Second, demographic homogeneity perpetuated biases that marginalised diverse perspectives, requiring the transformation of inclusion frameworks. Third, LOUD improved the discoverability of heritage data while requiring investment in accessibility paradigms that acknowledged technological differences. The research demonstrates that LOUD methodologies foster collaborative knowledge production through community engagement, confront power dynamics in inclusion frameworks, and provide mechanisms for democratising heritage access while accounting for technological disparities.},

In this study, we critically appraise the intersections and differences between the two movements. Based on our thematic comparison here, we conclude several key things. First, there is substantial scope for new communities of practice to form within scholarly communities that place sharing and collaboration/open participation at their focus. Second, Both the principles and practices of FOSS can be more deeply ingrained within scholarship, asserting a balance between pragmatism and social ideology. Third, at the present, Open Scholarship risks being subverted and compromised by commercial players. Fourth, the shift and acceleration towards a system of Open Scholarship will be greatly enhanced by a concurrent shift in recognising a broader range of practices and outputs beyond traditional peer review and research articles. In order to achieve this, we propose the formulation of a new type of institutional mandate. We believe that there is substantial need for research funders to invest in sustainable open scholarly infrastructure, and the communities that support them, to avoid the capture and enclosure of key research services that would prevent optimal researcher behaviours. Such a shift could ultimately lead to a healthier scientific culture, and a system where competition is replaced by collaboration, resources (including time and people) are shared and acknowledged more efficiently, and the research becomes inherently more rigorous, verified, and reproducible.},

However, researchers often face barriers, which may be perceived rather than real, hindering the adoption of ORD practices. To address this challenge, we propose using ORD support services as sustainable enablers to stimulate cultural change around ORD. We engaged stakeholders across the University of Zurich and the larger Swiss ORD community to identify which services would best serve as sustainable enablers. After defining ORD support services and categorizing them into six key areas, we conducted surveys and interviews to gather insights on service preferences and barriers to ORD adoption. Our findings reveal a strong preference for simpler, lower-resource services among researchers, highlighting the need for user-friendly and easily accessible support. Experts emphasized the importance of professional data stewardship, robust Research Data Management practices, and customized support to address discipline-specific needs. By combining survey and interview results, we additionally provide a detailed overview of stakeholders' ideas and suggestions for each proposed support area. Our study results in three recommendations for academic institutions aiming to stimulate a cultural shift towards ORD. By focusing on findable, accessible, and user-friendly services, equipping researchers with fundamental RDM skills, and moving towards the professionalization of data stewardship to provide customized support, institutions can foster the adoption of ORD practices. Ultimately, these measures can enhance the impact and reproducibility of scientific research.},
