# Paper Template

This is a template for the course assignment (20% of 7C2-CT module). You can reuse it and either submit a pull request or send the `.qmd` file to the lecturer. The paper should be between 900 and 1,100 words (excluding references).

Important: 

- Use cases (UC01-UC14) must be pre-assigned by the lecturer on a first-come, first-served basis
- Dataset selections must be discussed with and approved by the lecturer. UC15 is the only use case that can be assigned to multiple students

You can embed images in your document in several ways:

1. Using external URLs (be careful with licensing), such as <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Openscience.svg>:

```md
![Open Science Diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Openscience.svg)
```

![Open Science Diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Openscience.svg)

2. Using local files (when submitting via pull request):
You have two options for including images:
- Place them in the `assignments` folder alongside your `.qmd` file:

```md
![Your Image Caption](your-image.png)
```

- Create a dedicated images folder for your assignment (e.g., `assignments/your-name-images/`) and reference them:

```md
![Your Image Caption](your-name-images/your-image.png)
```

Note: When adding images via pull request:

- Use relative paths appropriate to your chosen folder structure
- Ensure you have rights to use and share the images
- Prefer open licensed images (Creative Commons, Public Domain)
- Keep image file sizes reasonable

To cite a reference, use the `@` symbol followed by the citation key. For example: This is discussed in @berners-leeLinkedData2006 (`@berners-leeLinkedData2006`) or [@wilkinsonFAIRGuidingPrinciples2016] (`[@wilkinsonFAIRGuidingPrinciples2016]`). Citation keys can be found in the references folder of the course repository. Add your own references to the file or create a dedicated `.bib` file.  

You can include code snippets to show data structure or analysis. For example:

```json
{
  "dataset": {
    "title": "Example Open Dataset",
    "publisher": "Open Data Institution",
    "updated": "2024-02-17",
    "license": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "distributions": [
      {
        "format": "CSV",
        "downloadURL": "https://example.org/data.csv",
        "mediaType": "text/csv"
      },
      {
        "format": "JSON",
        "downloadURL": "https://example.org/data.json",
        "mediaType": "application/json"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
